    Future changes will convert this concrete class into a polymorphic
    hierarchy modeled after `DimensionRecordStorage`, with many more
    `SqlRegistry` method implementations delegating to it.  Its interface
    may change significantly at the same time.  At present, this functionality
    has been factored out of `SqlRegistry` (with a bit of duplication) to
    allow the initial `QueryBuilder` design and implementation to be more
