    with dimension relationships.

    Parameters
    ----------
    registry : `SqlRegistry`
        Registry instance the query is being run against.
    fromClause : `sqlalchemy.sql.expression.FromClause`, optional
        Initial FROM clause for the query.
    whereClause : SQLAlchemy boolean expression, optional
        Expression to use as the initial WHERE clause.

        This is a thin wrapper around `QueryBuilder.joinDimensionElement`
        that updates the SELECT clause and hence requires that the dimension to
        be added has a table.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dimensions : `Dimension`
            Dimension to add.
        addResultColumns : `bool`
            If `True`, add the dimension's links to the SELECT clause so
            they are included in the query results.  Any links already selected
            from other dimensions will be ignored.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            Raised if the dimension has no table or view.

        The dimensions joined into the query and the dimensions used to
        identify the `DatasetType` need not be identical, but they should
        overlap.

        To ensure any dimensions that might relate to a `DatasetType` are
        present, `requireDataset` should generally only be called after
        all calls to `addDimension` have been made.

        ----------
