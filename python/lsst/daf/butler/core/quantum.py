    """A discrete unit of work that may depend on one or more datasets and

    Most Quanta will represent executions of a particular ``PipelineTask``â€™s

    units of work performed manually by human operators or other software
    agents.

        this Quantum.  If not provided, ``taskClass`` must be.
    taskClass : `type`, optional
        The Task class that executed or will execute this Quantum.  If not
        provided, ``taskName`` must be.  Overrides ``taskName`` if both are
        provided.
    dataId : `DataCoordinate`
        The dimension values that identify this `Quantum`.
    initInputs : `Mapping` [ `DatasetType`,  `DatasetRef` ]
