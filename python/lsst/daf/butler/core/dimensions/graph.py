    Notes
    -----
    `DimensionGraph`\s can only be constructed from an instance of a special
    subclass, `DimensionUniverse`, which itself constructed via from
    configuration (see `DimensionUniverse.fromConfig`).  A universe graph
    contains all dimension elements, and all other `DimensionGraph`\s or
    `DimensionSet`\s constructed from that universe are subsets of it.

    A `DimensionGraph` behaves much like a `DimensionSet` containing only
    `Dimension` objects, with a few key differences:

     - A `DimensionGraph` always contains all of the required dependencies of
       any of its elements.  That means some standard set operations (namely
       `symmetric_difference`/`^` and `difference`/`-`) can't behave the way
       one would expect, and hence aren't available (that's why
       `DimensionGraph` doesn't inherit from `collections.abc.Set` while
       `DimensionSet` does).

     - Any `DimensionJoin`\s whose dependencies are present in the graph are
       accessible via the `joins()` method (which is why we consider this
       graph - it contains the relationships as well as the elements of
       a system of dimensions).
