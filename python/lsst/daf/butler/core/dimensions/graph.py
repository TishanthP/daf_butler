class DimensionGraph:
    """An immutable, dependency-complete collection of dimensions.

    `DimensionGraph` behaves in many respects like a set of `Dimension`
    instances that maintains several special subsets and supersets of
    related `DimensionElement` instances.  It does not fully implement the
    `collections.abc.Set` interface, as its automatic expansion of dependencies
    would make set difference and XOR operations behave surprisingly.

    It also provides dict-like lookup of `DimensionElement` instances from
    their names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    universe : `DimensionUniverse`
        The special graph of all known dimensions of which this graph will be
        a subset.
    dimensions : iterable of `Dimension`, optional
        An iterable of `Dimension` instances that must be included in the
        graph.  All (recursive) dependencies of these dimensions will also
        be included.  At most one of ``dimensions`` and ``names`` must be
        provided.
    names : iterable of `str`, optional
        An iterable of the names of dimensiosn that must be included in the
        graph.  All (recursive) dependencies of these dimensions will also
        be included.  At most one of ``dimensions`` and ``names`` must be
        provided.
    conform : `bool`, optional
        If `True` (default), expand to include dependencies.  `False` should
        only be used for callers that can guarantee that other arguments are
        already correctly expanded, and is primarily for internal use.

    Notes
    -----
    `DimensionGraph` should be used instead of other collections in any context
    where a collection of dimensions is required and a `DimensionUniverse` is
    available.

    While `DimensionUniverse` inherits from `DimensionGraph`, it should
    otherwise not be used as a base class.
