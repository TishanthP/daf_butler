class TreeVisitor(ABC):
    """Definition of interface for visitor classes.

    Visitors and tree node classes implement Visitor pattern for tree
    traversal. Typical use case is to generate different representation
    of the tree, e.g. transforming parsed tree into SQLAlchemy clause.

    All methods of the class can (and most likely should) return the
    "transformed" value of the visited node. This value will be returned
    from the `Node.visit` method and it will also be passed as an argument
    to other methods of the visitor.

            The value associated with the visited node, the value is string,
            exactly as it appears in the original expression. Depending on
            use case it may need to be converted to `int` or `float`.
