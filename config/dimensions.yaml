    instrument:
      doc: >
        An entity that produces observations.  An instrument defines a set of
        physical_filters and detectors and a numbering system for the exposures
        and visits that represent observations with it.

      doc: >
        A filter that is not associated with a particular instrument.  An
        abstract filter can be used to relate similar physical filters, and
        is typically the filter associated with coadds.

    visit:
      doc: >
        A sequence of observations processed together, comprised of one or
        more exposures from the same instrument with the same pointing and
        physical_filter.
        The visit table contains metadata that is both meaningful only for
        science exposures and the same for all exposures in a visit.

        name: exposure_time
        type: float
        doc: >
          The total exposure time of the visit in seconds.  This should
          be equal to the sum of the exposure_time values for all
          constituent exposures (i.e. it should not include time between
          exposures).
      -
        name: seeing
        type: float
        doc: >
          Average seeing, measured as the FWHM of the Gaussian with the same
          effective area (arcsec).

    exposure:
      doc: >
        An observation associated with a particular instrument.  All direct
        observations are identified with an exposure, but derived datasets
        that may be based on more than one exposure (e.g. multiple snaps) are
        typically identified with visits instead, even for instruments that
        don't have multiple exposures per visit.  As a result, instruments
        that don't have multiple exposures per visit will typically have visit
        entries that are essentially duplicates of their exposure entries.

        The exposure table contains metadata entries that are relevant for
        calibration exposures, and does not duplicate entries in visit that
        would be the same for all exposures within a visit.
