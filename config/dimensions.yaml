    instrument:
      doc: >
        An entity that produces observations.  An instrument defines a set of
        physical_filters and detectors and a numbering system for the exposures
        and visits that represent observations with it.

      - instrument

    abstract_filter:
      doc: >
        A filter that is not associated with a particular instrument.  An
        abstract filter can be used to relate similar physical filters, and
        is typically the filter associated with coadds.

      dependencies:
        required:
        - instrument
        implied:
        - abstract_filter
      doc: >
        A filter associated with a particular instrument.  physical_filters are
        used to identify datasets that can only be associated with a single
        observation.

    detector:
      dependencies:
        required:
        - instrument
      doc: >
        A detector associated with a particular instrument (not an observation
        of that detector; that requires specifying an exposure or visit as
        well).

      dependencies:
        required:
        - instrument
        implied:
        - physical_filter
      doc: >
        A sequence of observations processed together, comprised of one or
        more exposures from the same instrument with the same pointing and
        physical_filter.
        The visit table contains metadata that is both meaningful only for
        science exposures and the same for all exposures in a visit.

        - physical_filter
      doc: >
        An observation associated with a particular instrument.  All direct
        observations are identified with an exposure, but derived datasets
        that may be based on more than one exposure (e.g. multiple snaps) are
        typically identified with visits instead, even for instruments that
        don't have multiple exposures per visit.  As a result, instruments
        that don't have multiple exposures per visit will typically have visit
        entries that are essentially duplicates of their exposure entries.

        The exposure table contains metadata entries that are relevant for
        calibration exposures, and does not duplicate entries in visit that
        would be the same for all exposures within a visit.

    skypix:
      doc: >
        A pixel in a hierarchical decomposition of the sky (e.g. HTM, Q3C, or
        HEALPix; we will select and support just one, but which is TBD). Has
        no SQL representation; even a definition table is not necessary, given
        that the allowable values and the associated hasRegion regions are best
        computed on-the-fly.  skypix units are preferred to skymap (i.e.
        tract-patch) units for Datasets without any overlap regions (e.g.
        sharded reference catalogs).

        There are also considerable advantages to standardizing on just one
        level of the standard pixelization: if all skypix values are at a
        single level, they can be indexed using standard B-Trees and compared
        with simple equality comparison.  In contrast, comparing skypix values
        at different levels requires pixelization-specific bit-shifting
        operations and custom indexes, which are much harder to implement
        across multiple RDMSs.  As a result, we will (at least initially) try
        to define just a single level for all skypix values.  Our preliminary
        guess is that this level should have pixels be approximately (within a
        factor of ~4) of the size of a single detector on the sky.

    label:
      doc: >
        An arbitrary string value.  There is no SQL representation or

        represented (by convention) by a comma-separated string.

        overlap, we could include that in this view to refine the results.
