Added `DimensionElement.schema` as a less SQL-oriented way to inspect the fields of a `DimensionRecord`.

Also added two high-level containers (`DimensionRecordSet` and `DimensionRecordTable`) for `DimensionRecord` objects, but these should be considered experimental and unstable until they are used in public `Butler` APIs.
