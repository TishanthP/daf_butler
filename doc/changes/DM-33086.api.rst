A new optional parameter, ``record_validation_info`` has been added to `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler.ingest` (and related datastore APIs) to allow the caller to declare that file attributes such as the file size or checksum should not be recorded.
This can be useful if the file is being monitored by an external system or it is known that the file might be compressed in-place after ingestion.
