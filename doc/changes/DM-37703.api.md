* Creating an unresolved dataset reference now issues an `UnresolvedRefWarning` and is deprecated.
* A resolved `DatasetRef` can now be created by specifying the run without the ID -- the constructor will now automatically issue an ID.
  Previously this was an error.
  To support ID generation a new optional parameter `is_generation_mode` can now be given to the constructor to allow the ID to be constructed in different ways.
