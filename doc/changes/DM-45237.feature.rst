Added ``--no-track-file-attrs`` to ``butler import`` (and associated import API) and ``butler ingest-files`` commands to allow an import/ingest to disable the calculation of file sizes on ingest.
This can be useful if you are importing thousands of files from an object store where the file size determination can take a significant amount of time.
