Regular expressions in collection and dataset type patterns are now deprecated. (Shell-like globs will continue to be supported.)

Materializing dataset queries into temporary tables is now deprecated.  (Materializing data ID queries will continue to be supported.)

The `datasetTypes` argument to `Registry.queryCollections` is now deprecated. (This parameter has never had any effect.)

We will soon stop raising `DataIdValueError` exceptions for typos and other bad values in query expressions like `instrument='HsC'` for typos and other bad values in query expressions.  Instead, these queries will return an empty iterable of results.

Using HTM and HEALPix spatial dimensions like `htm11` or `healpix10` in data ID constraints passed to queries is now deprecated. The exception is `htm7`, which will continue to work.

The `--no-check` parameter to `butler query-dimension-records` is now deprecated.

The `offset` argument to `limit()` for `Registry.queryDataIds` and `Registry.queryDimensionRecords` result objects is now deprecated.

The `--offset` option for `butler query-data-ids` and `butler-query-datasets` is no longer supported, and will raise on exception if you attempt to use it.

It will soon become mandatory to explicitly provide `--collections` and a dataset type search when calling `butler query-datasets`.

Using `Butler.collections` to get the list of default collections is now deprecated.  Use `Butler.collections.defaults` instead.
