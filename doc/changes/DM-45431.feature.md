The ParquetFormatter now declares it can_accept Arrow tables, Astropy tables, Numpy tables, and pandas DataFraemes.
This means that we have complete lossless storage of any parquet-compatible type into a datastore that has declared a different type; e.g. an astropy table with units can be persisted into a DataFrame storage class without those units being stripped.
This ticket also adds can_accept to the InMemoryDatastore delegates, and now one ArrowTableDelegate handles all the parquet-compatible datasets.
