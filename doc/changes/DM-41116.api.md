- `Butler` class becomes an abstract base class, original `Butler` was renamed to `DirectButler`.
- Clients that need an access to `DirectButler` class will have to import it from `lsst.daf.butler.direct_butler`.
- `Butler.from_config(...)` should be used to make `Butler` instances. `Butler(...)` still works and is identical to `Butler.from_config(...)`, but will generate `mypy` errors.
