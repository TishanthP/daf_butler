* A new query system and interface is now available using ``butler.query()`` as a context manager.
  This new system is much more flexible and supports far more expressive queries, and no longer requires the results to be placed in a `set` to removed duplication.
* Added ``butler.query_datasets()``, ``butler.query_dimension_records()`` and ``butler.query_data_ids()`` as replacements for the ``butler.registry`` equivalents.
  These use the new query system and are preferred over the old interfaces.
* The experimental collections querying interface is now public and called ``butler.collections.query_info`` and ``butler.collections.query``.
* The command line tools ``query-datasets``, ``associate``, ``retrieve-artifacts`` and ``transfer-datasets`` now support a ``--limit`` parameter.
  The default for all except ``associate`` (which defaults to no limit) is to limit the number of results to 10,000.
  A warning will be issued if the cap is hit.
* The command line tools ``query-datasets``, ``associate``, ``retrieve-artifacts`` and ``transfer-datasets`` now support ``--order-by`` to control the sorting in conjunction with ``--limit``.
  For ``query-datasets`` this will also control the sorting of the reported tables.
