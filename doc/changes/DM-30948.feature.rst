Support LSST-style visit definitions where a single exposure is part of a set of related exposures all taken with the same acquisition command.
Each exposure knows the "visit" it is part of.

* Modify the ``exposure`` dimension record to include ``seq_start`` and ``seq_end`` metadata.
* Modify ``visit`` record to include a ``seq_num`` field.
* Remove ``visit_system`` dimension and add ``visit_system_membership`` record to allow a visit to be associated with multiple visit systems.
