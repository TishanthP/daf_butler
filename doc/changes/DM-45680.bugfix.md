Fix an issue where boolean metadata columns (like `exposure.can_see_sky` and
`exposure.has_simulated`) were not usable in `where` clauses for Registry query
functions.  These column names can now be used as a boolean expression, for
example `where="exposure.can_see_sky` or `where="NOT exposure.can_see_sky"`.
