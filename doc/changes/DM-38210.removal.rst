* Deprecated ``Butler.getDirect()`` and ``Butler.putDirect()``.
  We have modified the ``get()`` and ``put()`` variants to recognize the presence of a resolved ``DatasetRef`` and use it directly.
  For ``get()`` we no longer unpack the ``DatasetRef`` and re-run the query, but return exactly the dataset being requested.
* Removed ``Butler.pruneCollections``.
  This method was replaced by ``Butler.removeRuns`` and ``Registry.removeCollections`` a long time ago and the command-line interface was removed previously.
