The ``Datastore`` base class was changed so that subclasses are no longer
required to have the same constructor parameters as the base class.  Subclasses
are now required to implement ``_create_from_config`` for creating an instance
from the ``Datastore.fromConfig`` static method, and ``clone`` for creating a
copy of an existing instance.
