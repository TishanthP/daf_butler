Added `Butler._query` context manager which will support building of the complex queries for data in Butler.
For now `Butler._query` provides access to just three convenience methods similar to query methods in `Registry`.
This new API should be considered experimental and potentially unstable, its use should be limited to downstream middleware code for now.
